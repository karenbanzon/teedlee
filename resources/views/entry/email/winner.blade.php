                <p>Dear {{ $user->username }},</p>
                <p>Congratulations! Your design {{ $entry->title }} has won the {{ $contest->title }}!</p>
                <p>Great work! We're excited to see your design on the store, but before that, weâ€™ll need the original artwork from you.</p>
                <p>Our preferred file formats are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI or .EPS, in CMYK color mode, fonts must be outlined (converted to vector), and links must be embedded.</li>
                    <li>.PSD, in CMYK color mode, 300dpi resolution, layered by color (NOT fattened), and fonts must be rasterized.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Files must be editable (and high resolution if you're using a pixel-based software such as Photoshop) so minor adjustments can be applied in production.</p>
                <p>{{ Html::link('mailto:admin@teedlee.ph', 'SUBMIT ORIGINAL ARTWORK') }}</p>
